# Training-Validation-Splitter
Splits a .csv file into training and validation datasets

This script was initially created to split the 2022 Georgia Coastal Survey into training and validation datasets for Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Correciton. This project was funded by a grant awarded from the Georgia Coastal Department of Natural Resources to Georgia Southern University. The DEM data is to be used for SLAMM Modeling of Georgia Marshes, as well as for my thesis on supervised classification of groundcover using satellite data.

While this script was created specifically for this RTK data, it should work for any .csv file as long as filenames and variables are changed throughout. This script was created in Google Colab.
